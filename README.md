## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Apps I like and why:**
1. Duolingo
   - Regular reminders to users to complete their lesson of their day gives them motivation to learn and also helps them integrate language learning into their regular schedule
   - Interactive learning method that makes language learning fun while still informative
   - Add and stay connected with friends: learning is better when done with other people
  
 2. TooGoodToGo
    - Filter restaurants by likes, locations and pick-up times
    - Users can favorite certain restaurants that they want to pick up rom
    - Users can browse for restaurants out of their region
   
 3. Depop
    - Users can like, save and buy items and also chat with Sellers
    - Sellers can boost their listing to be viewed by more people
    - You can filter items by a large range of options
